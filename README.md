# Routing Announcement Alfred Through

## About

This is a concept of the dynamic announce mechanism which uses B.A.T.M.A.N. and A.L.F.R.E.D. as a background for spreading and getting static routes between MESH nodes without any other dynamic route protocols.

The idea was taken from BMX6/BMX7/OLSR mesh daemons, which are able to use a global cloud network and share local networks behind them between each other. In mesh-specific protocols it is called the HNA (host and network association).

RAAT uses [UTHASH](https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/) to implement the method to hold the information about nodes and routes.

## How it works

The example of such network presented on the screen below, where the batman interface (bat0) of each node has the mask 172.16.0.0/16. In this case each node has also an additional local network (br-lan) with mask 27 with the same (as a cloud) ip address for clarity, it might have any network mask.

![Concept of network](https://github.com/nickbash11/raat/blob/master/raat-network.png)


For example, we want the PC2 could reach to the PC4 and vice versa, so we have to do some manupilations with iproute2 command line like that:

On the NODE04:
```ip route add 172.16.200.0/27 via 172.16.200.1```

On the NODE03:
```ip route add 172.16.150.0/27 via 172.16.150.1```

Then PC2 and PC4 will be able to see each other, so, the RAAT daemon doing this automatically through A.L.F.R.E.D.

It pushes its own routes to and pulls them from other participants of the MESH network. Now it uses iproute2 via pipe to manage routing table.

## Default routes

RAAT can pick the best quality default route by using TQ from "batctl o"

## Get and compilation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nickbash11/raat.git
$ cd raat/src
$ make && strip raat
```

I compile it right on OpenWRT host, so it needs to install gcc, make and git-http:

```
opkg update
opkg install gcc make gcc-http
```

## Use

**Of course, before using you have to have the working BATMAN network, also installed and running ALFRED daemon.**
**You can find all examples in the appropriate directory (openwrt-configs).**

In simple case you can only tell to the RAAT the BATMAN interface

```
./raat -i bat0
```

Or you would like to publish your lans and wan (if those are exist):

```
./raat -i bat0 -l -w
```

Then in a few moment later, you can see the status of the available routes by using option -I:

```
./raat -I
last update: 2020-11-30 16:34:44

push:
mac                ipv4		routes
ea:59:11:5e:35:31  172.16.50.1	172.16.50.0/27*

pull:
mac                originator         timestamp   miss  ipv4		routes
b6:95:72:31:11:d5  00:00:00:dd:aa:cc  1606743271  0     172.16.150.1	172.16.150.0/27*
a2:c5:b0:c1:41:90  08:00:27:b5:63:b1  1606743275  0     172.16.200.1	default*172.16.200.0/27*

default route:
4e:20:5a:01:e4:33  00:00:00:44:22:11  1606743274  0     172.16.100.1	default*172.16.100.0/27*

```

At the same time you can see in your rule table something like:

```
ip rule
0:	from all lookup local 
30000:	from all to 172.16.150.0/27 lookup 858
30000:	from all to 172.16.200.0/27 lookup 573
30000:	from all to 172.16.100.0/27 lookup 336
32766:	from all lookup main
32767:	from all lookup default
33333:	from all lookup 336
```

Where the priorities 30000 and 33333 are controlled by RAAT.

To kill the daemon properly use QUIT:

```
kill -QUIT `cat /var/run/raat.pid`
```

## OpenWrt against x86_64

Mainly it has been developed for OpenWrt and testing on it, so you can find out how to use an OpenWrt SDK to compile RAAT for other than x86_64 platforms by going to [wiki page.](https://github.com/nickbash11/raat/wiki/RAAT-for-OpenWRT)

## Command line options

```
Usage: raat -i bat0

	-i interface	Batman or bridge interface which contains batman
			interface. This interface's ipv4 address
			will be announced as a route for other nodes
        -w		Publish WAN interface as a default route
	-l		Publish LAN routes. For now it finds br-lan interfaces
	-s 10		Range between push and pull operations
			(default 10 seconds), can be from 1 to 60
	-m 5		How many times to wait until a node will be
			considered as a dead (default 5 times). It
			depends on -s and can be from 1 to 30
	-t 100		Data type in alfred space, from 64 to 255
	-I		Get the information from shared memory
	-v		Show version
	-h		Show this help
```

## Testing

I have been testing RAAT in virtualbox. For emulate wifi devices you can use the project from [Raizo62](https://github.com/Raizo62/vwifi)

## Thoughts

* This time RAAT uses timestamps for evaluate the availability of a node, when the parameter "miss" exceeds a threshold then a node considers as a dead. It was a good practice to use with pure ALFRED method, but, then I forced to use TQ for define the best default route from batctl... so it confuses me. I still think that the RAAT must use only ALFRED.

* Raat uses pipes for manage all its communications between alfred, iproute2 and batman. Instead, it has to use native functions and sockets to communicate. UDS for alfred, functions from batctl, and netlink to control routing tables and rules.
